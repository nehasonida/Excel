📃 Project :- 🏍️ Bike Sales Dashboard using Excel.

🟡 Business Case :\
To create a dashboard to analyze the bike sales count and different factors which affects the demand for bike.

🟡 Dataset analysis :\
(1.) Understanding the dataset provided.\
(2.) Data cleaning like removing duplicates, spaces and special characters, find and replace, formatting.\
(3.) Created nested functions, custom columns to get additional information from the dataset.\
(4.) Created Pivot tables, Charts and Graphs 📊📈 to summarise the data and visually get the information quickly.\
(5.) Finally builded a dashboard adding slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it for different conditions.\
(6.) Added text cards and created Clear Filters button using VBA code to clear all filters in one click.

🟡 Key insights :\
✅ Male people get the maximum average income of approx $60,000. So, they purchased bikes more as compared to females who got 7% less average income than males.\
✅ Couples with 2 or less than 2 children are inclined to buy bikes more.\
✅ People of Middle Age group (31 - 54 years) purchased 4 times more bikes as compared to Adolescent and Old age groups.\
✅ Customers tend to purchase bikes more for shorter commute (0-1 miles) than longer commute (more than 10 miles).

🟡 Note - Can help a company determine their target customers based on various factors such as income, age, distance, martial status, region, education, occupation. Additionally, it can provide a basis for developing new strategies to improve the marketing and overall sales of bikes.

   I believe that the skills I have acquired while creating this dashboard will be valuable in my future endeavours.
